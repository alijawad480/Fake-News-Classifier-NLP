# ðŸ“° Fake News Classifier (LSTM + Regularization)

A deep learning project to classify news articles as **Real** or **Fake** using **LSTM networks**.  
The model is trained with **Mini-batch Gradient Descent**, **L2 Regularization**, and **Dropout** to prevent overfitting, using a cleaned text **corpus** for better generalization.

Preprocess Text & Build Corpus
Lowercasing

Removing punctuation & stopwords

Tokenization using Keras Tokenizer

Creating a corpus (list of cleaned sentences)

Padding sequences to the same length

Regularization Techniques Used
L2 Regularization: Prevents large weight values by adding a penalty term.

Dropout: Randomly drops neurons during training to avoid overfitting.

Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Improves convergence and stability.
